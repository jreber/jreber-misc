# Articles and Videos I Like
I have a tendency to keep articles I like permanently open in browser tabs,
turning my browser into a clumsy repo of things I like. No more!

## Articles
* [Finding the Energy to Work on Your Side Hustle](https://www.startups.co/articles/finding-the-energy-to-work-on-your-sidehustle?ref=quuu&utm_content=buffer98172&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer)
* [How Developers Stop Learning: Rise of the Expert Beginner](https://www.daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/)
* [Out of the Tar Pit](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/design/out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf?raw=true): Analyzes software complexity and how to wrangle it. Defines accidental and essential complexity, which is a brilliant distinction. Further argues that state and control are the two biggest drivers of software complexity, that most state is accidental and so should be eliminated if possible, and suggests an framework to separate essential state and logic from accidental-but-useful state and control. Brilliant.
* [Politics and the English Language](http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit/): An essay by George Orwell arguing against unthinking and muddled use of language, particularly as is used in politics. I find myself recalling this essay as I think about persuasion, writing code, and communicating my ideas.
* [Processing Documents with Transducers](https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/xpath-in-transducers.html) *Specific to Clojure but it was very enlightening to see alternative ways to traverse documents.*
* [Programming as Theory Building](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf): Argues that programming is about devising a theory of the problem at hand and how that problem should be solved; the author contrasts this with the view that programming is about delivering code or other artifacts. The distinction seemss small but leads to interesting implications.
* [Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.html)
* [Why A Lifestyle Business Beats a Startup](https://bugfender.com/blog/why-a-lifestyle-business-beats-a-startup/)
* [Why Functional Programming Matters](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf)

### Others
* [Inventing on Principle](https://vimeo.com/36579366), by Bret Victor
* [The Future of Programming](https://vimeo.com/71278954), by Bret Victor. Pretty good: great reminder of just how much of software was foreseen decades ago, and I like this quote: "The most dangerous thought that you can have as a creative person is to think that you know what you're doing. Because once you think you know what you're doing you stop looking around for other ways of doing things and you stop being able to see other ways of doing things. You become blind."
